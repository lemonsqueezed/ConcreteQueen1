## "CONCRETE JUNGLE" is an indie game made during the fall (October-November) 2021 Queer Coderz camp hosted by Camp Maven, House Lives Matter (HLM), and the Hetrick-Martin Institute (HMI). It follows a shy drag queen new to the scene who, after their first performance, are immediately scouted by three different house mothers. They must choose a house and make their mother proud by participating in their first real competition.
